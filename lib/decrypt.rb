# Additionally, you should create a Runner file called
# decrypt.rb that takes four command line arguments. The
# first is an existing file that contains an encrypted
# message. The second is a file where your program should
# write the decrypted message. The third is the key to be
# used for decryption. The fourth is the date to be used
# for decryption. In addition to writing the decrypted
#   message to the file, your program should output to
#   the screen the file it wrote to, the key used for
#   decryption, and the date used for decryption.
